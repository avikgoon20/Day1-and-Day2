In Java, string is basically an object, which get stored in heap memory. String is not an primitive data type, rather it is a class.
Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example:

String s="welcome";  
Each time we create a string literal, the JVM checks the "string constant pool" first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If the string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool. For example:
String s1="Welcome";  
String s2="Welcome";//It doesn't create a new instance  
String can be created in two ways:
1. String s1="Welcome";  
2.String s1= new String("Welcome");

String s1="Welcome"; 
String s2="Welcome";  // same instance(s1) is returning because of string pool concept in java 

if(s1 == s2 ) // this will return true;

But:

String s1="Welcome";  
String s1= new String("Welcome"); // new keyword creating a new instance

if( s1 == s2 ) this will return false
